# Public repository for Casper ecosystem containing information about projects, services, service providers, and code repositories.

The https://casperblockchain.io site uses the stored data in this repository to visualize the Casper ecosystem.

## Casper Ecosystem

All entries reside in the `casperblockchain-data/ecosystem` subdirectory. 

When adding a new entry, we create a unique directory name and add `data.md` file inside.

### `data.md` file contents
